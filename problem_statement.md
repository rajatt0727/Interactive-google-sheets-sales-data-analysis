### Problem Statement

**Context:**
The company operates in multiple cities, selling a variety of office supplies, furniture, and technology products across different customer segments. The primary objective is to optimize sales performance, profitability, and customer satisfaction across different regions, product categories, and customer segments. However, the company has been facing challenges in understanding the underlying trends that drive profitability and identifying areas where operational efficiency can be improved.

**Challenges:**
1. **Sales and Profitability across Cities**: The company operates in multiple cities, but not all cities are contributing equally to profits. Some cities, like Wrocław, are even generating losses. The need is to identify why certain cities underperform and what steps can be taken to address it.
   
2. **Customer Segmentation and Sales**: Sales are distributed across various customer segments, including Corporate, Consumer, Home Office, and Small Business. However, a balanced strategy targeting these segments is required to ensure each contributes meaningfully to revenue and profitability.

3. **Product Category Profitability**: Not all product categories are profitable. Certain categories, such as "Tables," are generating losses, while others, like "Binders and Accessories," are highly profitable. This demands a careful review of the product mix to maximize profitability while addressing underperforming categories.

4. **Sales and Return Rates**: A return rate of 0.81% could indicate customer dissatisfaction or issues with product quality or fit. The company needs to minimize returns to increase overall profitability.

5. **Weekly Order Patterns**: Sales trends vary throughout the week, and understanding these patterns can help optimize marketing efforts and operational logistics, ensuring that the workforce and resources are aligned with peak demand.

6. **Top-Performing Product Categories**: The top five categories in terms of order volume (e.g., Paper, Binders, Telephones) suggest a potential focus area for marketing and sales strategy. However, deeper analysis is needed to confirm that these top-selling products are also profitable.

**Key Questions:**
- Why is Wrocław generating a loss while other cities are profitable?
- How can the company improve sales and profitability within underperforming product categories and cities?
- Are there opportunities to better target specific customer segments to maximize sales?
- How can the company reduce the return rate, and what are the underlying causes of returns?
- What steps can be taken to better align sales efforts with daily sales patterns to increase operational efficiency?

**Objective:**
To create a detailed dashboard that visualizes sales, profits, and customer segmentation across different metrics, helping the company make data-driven decisions to:
1. Identify underperforming areas.
2. Optimize the product mix.
3. Target the right customer segments.
4. Improve overall profitability across all cities and product categories.
