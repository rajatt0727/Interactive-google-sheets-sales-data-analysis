### Solutions Achieved

The dashboard serves as an effective solution to the problem statement, providing detailed insights into various aspects of the company’s sales, profitability, and customer segments. Below are the key solutions that have been achieved through this interactive dashboard:

---

#### 1. **City-Specific Profitability**
   - **Problem:** Certain cities, like Wrocław, were generating losses while others, like Krakow and Lodz, were profitable.
   - **Solution Achieved:** 
     - The city-specific profit section of the dashboard provides a clear visualization of profits across key cities. Wrocław’s negative profit of **€-14,424** is highlighted, indicating underperformance.
     - Profitable cities such as Krakow (€77,365), Lodz (€85,291), and Warsaw (€75,845) are also displayed, helping management understand where their investments and sales efforts are yielding positive results.
     - This allows for city-specific strategies to improve Wrocław’s profitability, potentially through enhanced marketing or product adjustments.

#### 2. **Customer Segment Sales Distribution**
   - **Problem:** There was a need to better target different customer segments to maximize sales and profitability.
   - **Solution Achieved:**
     - The pie charts clearly show the distribution of sales across customer segments: Corporate, Consumer, Home Office, and Small Business, each contributing **34.2%** equally across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.
     - This allows for better understanding of how sales are distributed, which customer segments can be targeted further, and how the company can craft personalized strategies for different customer bases.

#### 3. **Product Category Profitability**
   - **Problem:** Some product categories were profitable while others were incurring losses, such as "Tables" (€-47,520).
   - **Solution Achieved:**
     - The **Product Profits** section provides an overview of profitability for each product category. For example, **Binders and Accessories** generated a high profit of **€59,225**, while categories like **Tables** suffered losses.
     - This clear categorization helps the company make informed decisions about which product lines to promote and which to reconsider or discontinue, enabling better product mix management.

#### 4. **Top 5 Product Categories**
   - **Problem:** The company needed to understand which product categories are driving sales volume.
   - **Solution Achieved:**
     - The **Top 5 Product Categories** section of the dashboard identifies the most-ordered product categories. Categories like **Paper (294 orders)**, **Binders and Binder Accessories (200 orders)**, and **Telephones (194 orders)** are highlighted, indicating popular product lines that can be further leveraged.
     - While this doesn’t directly reflect profitability, it provides a pathway to identify which high-demand products can be further optimized for profitability.

#### 5. **Weekly Order Patterns**
   - **Problem:** Sales trends fluctuated across the week, requiring optimization of resource allocation.
   - **Solution Achieved:**
     - The **City Order Heatmap** clearly displays the order volumes by day of the week for different cities. For example, Krakow sees peak orders on Fridays and Saturdays, while Wrocław’s orders are more consistent but fewer.
     - By using this information, the company can allocate marketing resources and staff more effectively, ensuring the right support is available during peak days in specific cities.

#### 6. **Sales and Profit Timeline**
   - **Problem:** There was a need to track sales and profits over time to identify trends and anomalies.
   - **Solution Achieved:**
     - The **Sales/Profit Timeline** graph tracks the company's performance over time, identifying peaks and valleys in sales and profits. This can help in forecasting future demand, identifying seasonality, and understanding how various campaigns and product launches impacted financial results.

#### 7. **Order Returns and Return Rate**
   - **Problem:** Return rates of 0.81% required reduction to boost profitability.
   - **Solution Achieved:**
     - The dashboard tracks total orders, returned orders, and the percentage of returns. With **11 returned orders** out of **1,365 total orders** (return rate of **0.81%**), the company can drill down into specific products or regions contributing to these returns, allowing for corrective actions to reduce this percentage further.
